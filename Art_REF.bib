  abstract  = {Smart material reinforced non-destructive structural health monitoring technique has been evolving as the most predominated route for assessing the performance of the civil structures. In the present study, multiwalled nanotubes (MWNT) were suitably incorporated into the cement matrix, which act as actively embedded sensor for monitoring real-time flaws in structures. Initially, the stable homogenous MWNT dispersion was prepared by using ionic surfactant technique with high-intensity ultrasonic agitation process. Since, a suitable and adequate synthesis procedure to incorporate MWNT in cement matrix is essential, but complicated, the role of amplitude and frequency of sonication on dispersion of nanotubes was categorically evaluated. Further, this paper focuses to find out the effect of surfactant on MWNT dispersion by using the UV Visible spectroscopy and by evaluating the effective hydro-dynamic diameter. Based on micromechanics based analytical model, the influence of the interface layer thickness and geometrical configuration of nanotubes on the electrical conductivity of cement nano-composite are also analyzed. Further, the electrical conductivity of MWNT incorporated cement system, as developed in the present study, is measured using four probe method. Piezo-resistivity of the oven dried samples is measured to evaluate the change in potential drop under cyclic loading regime. It is found that the efficiency of the piezo-resistive strain sensors greatly depends on synthesis process and the circuit system. Appropriately proportioned and properly synthesized MWNTs incorporated in cement matrix were capable of providing consistent and steady response under the variable external stress. Thus, the material can be used as embedded sensor for health monitoring and identifying initiation of any damage in reinforced concrete structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Electrically conductive cement-based composites doped with carbon nanotubes possess the functional properties of being strain- and damage-sensitive, thus providing a cost-effective solution for monitoring of concrete structures. The weak point of the technology is the dispersion of the nanotubes, typically based on special procedures, such as sonication, that are not suitable for large scale applications. This paper presents a systematic investigation on various procedures for fabricating carbon-nanotube-cement pastes, mortars and concretes. Dispersion of nanotubes in water is achieved using chemical dispersants and different mixing strategies, while quality of nanotubes' dispersion is assessed by measuring the rate of nanotube separation and by SEM inspections. Electrical percolation and strain-sensitivity are investigated in order to assess the quality of the fabricated composites. The results of this research allow to identify a processing procedure that, without sonication, might be potentially effective for fabricating self-sensing cement-based composites in a way that is compatible with large scale deployment. In particular, similarly to what observed in the case of sonicated specimens, the percolation thresholds of mortars and concretes fabricated with the "scalable" procedure are seen to be around 1{\%} w. of MWCNTs content with respect of the weight of cement, while the same percolation threshold is less evident for pastes. Electrical conductivity and gauge factor of the same samples are also similar to those of sonicated composites, whereby conductivity of composite pastes, mortars and concretes assumes values of 5.2E-4, 1.8E-4 and 1.0E-4 (Omega cm)(-1), respectively, while gauge factors are equal to 130, 68 and 23, respectively.

Structures can develop damage throughout their operational lifetimes, typically due to excessive loading, harsh environmental and loading conditions, and long-term deterioration. To evaluate the condition of structures, conventional structural health monitoring (SHM) systems employ discrete sensors such as accelerometers, displacement transducers, and strain gages, among others. Although these sensors provide quantitative data that can be correlated to structural behavior, it remains challenging to accurately detect and locate damage effectively. This chapter presents a summary of recent developments in using carbon nanotubes for the design of nanocomposite thin films that are sensitive to damage (specifically strain). In particular, the chapter presents in great detail the design and strain-sensing properties of three different types of nanofilms: buckypaper, layer-by-layer, and spray-coated films. In addition, nanofilms were also deposited on aggregates, and these nanofilm-coated aggregates were used for casting multifunctional cementitious composites that could bear loads while their electrical properties were sensitive to damage. The chapter also includes a brief discussion of the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) algorithm, which enables one to estimate the spatial conductivity (or resistivity) distribution of a conductive body. When applied to nanofilms or nanofilm-enhanced cementitious composites, it was shown that this technique allowed for the detection of damage severity and the identification of damage location in a precise and efficient manner. The chapter concludes with a summary of other avenues of research and a discussion of future research challenges that need to be addressed in order for this technology to be adopted for real-world SHM applications.},

abstract = {Special attributes such as self-sensing ability could be included in conventional concrete-like materials, using carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and carbon fibers (CF), which have recently come to the forefront due to their superior mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. However, their non-uniform distribution in cementitious systems stands in the way of taking full advantage of their benefits. To address this issue, an experimental study was undertaken, proposing several mixing methods to achieve uniform distribution. The performance of each method was assessed based on electrical resistivity (ER) and compressive strength measurements. Continuous reductions in ER measurements were observed with time, regardless of the mixing method and carbon-based materials used. Ultrasonication did not appear to be as useful as mechanical mixing with shear effect in terms of ER and compressive strength. Test results revealed that using longer CF (12 mm) in cementitious composites was the best way to tailor matrix properties in terms of electrical conductivity and compressive strength. CF was also easy to mix and has a relatively lower manufacturing cost than other electrically conductive carbon-based materials. {\textcopyright}2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wen2007,
abstract = {A scheme for monitoring concrete structures, by embedding PZT ceramics into concrete modules has been proposed previously. These modules can be used as building blocks in the infrastructure engineering. Owing to the piezoelectric device embedment, the blocks are sensitive to ambient condition changes including stress, temperature, and humidity. It is suggested that by measuring the equivalent circuit parameters of embedded piezoelectric ceramics, the structural-static or quasi-static state may be interrogated. The equivalent circuit parameters of a piezoelectric device represent the characteristics of the piezoelectric, dielectric, and mechanical performances. By analyzing the parameters, the signal related to the structural-mechanical state can be acquired. Theoretically, a piezoelectric device can be modeled as a multiple-input-multiple-output transducer. In practice, the problem remains that the equivalent parameters, the sensing outputs, are also dependent on the ambient settings such as temperature which may cause either expansion or shrinkage. However, through dozens of experiments with smart concrete specimens embedded with piezoelectric elements and piezoelectric elements free of embedment, it is observed that the characteristic frequencies (anti-resonance and resonance) are quite sensitive to temperature but have little dependence on stress. This way, by sensing data fusion, the characteristic frequencies are used as temperature indicators to remove the variation in equivalent circuit parameters resulting from temperature, exclusive of using additional sensors for compensation. In turn, the structural stress-monitoring (static or quasi-static) through the detection of the equivalent circuit parameters is achieved.},

The present study is focused on manufacturing of self-sensing smart concretes and investigates their mechanical and piezoresistive behavior for health monitoring of concrete structures. To this end, concrete is combined with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to produce an internal electrical network. Using the high piezoresistive properties of the carbon nanotubes, the concrete is able to indicate the mechanical stresses. Carbon nanotubes are also capable of reinforcing concretes and increasing mechanical strength. To this end, the concrete nanocomposite was prepared in three general cases including cement paste and concretes of grade 400 and 350 for water-cement ratios of 0.45 and 0.6. Then, the effect of different weight percentages of carbon nanotubes on the electrical and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite was experimentally investigated. In the next stage, the piezoresistive property of concrete was investigated when subject to static and dynamic loads. The results indicate that concrete nanocomposites are sensitive to the amount of applied compressive stresses so that application of compressive stresses up to 6 MPa leads to changes of up to 8 percent in the electrical resistance of concrete in the case of using cement paste nanocomposite reinforced with 1 wt.{\%} of carbon nanotubes. {\textcopyright}2018, {\textcopyright}2018 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This study presents early crack detection of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) under varying temperature and humidity conditions using an instantaneous electrical impedance acquisition system. SFRC has the self-sensing capability of electrical impedance without sensor installation thanks to the conductivity of embedded steel fibers, making it possible to effectively monitor cracks initiated in SFRC. However, the electrical impedance is often sensitively changed by environmental effects such as temperature and humidity variations. Thus, the extraction of only crack-induced feature from the measured impedance responses is a crucial issue for the purpose of structural health monitoring. In this study, the instantaneous electrical impedance acquisition system incorporated with SFRC is developed. Then, temperature, humidity and crack initiation effects on the impedance responses are experimentally investigated. Based on the impedance signal pattern observation, it is turned out that the temperature effect is more predominant than the crack initiation and humidity effects. Various crack steps are generated through bending tests, and the corresponding impedance damage indices are extracted by compensating the dominant temperature effect. The test results reveal that propagated cracks as well as early cracks are successfully detected under temperature and humidity variations. Copyright {\textcopyright}2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd. An XFEM multiscale approach is adopted in order to investigate the mechanical properties and fracture behavior of carbon nanotube reinforced concrete specimen. At the nanoscale, molecular dynamics simulation is used to find the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube (CNTs). Afterwards, a hydration model is adopted to find the chemical composition of cement paste. The hydrated model and CNTs are then converted into a finite element mesh for further analysis. Finally, at the meso scale the fracture behavior of the CNT reinforced concrete is simulated by the XFEM approach. The results indicate that the fracture energy of samples with similar volume fractions but reinforced by longer CNTs increase significantly, but addition of CNTs has little influence on the elastic modulus. In addition, the extent of crack propagation under a similar load level becomes considerably lower for the concrete samples reinforce by longer CNTs.},

abstract = {A new type of sensor for structural health monitoring (SHM) has emerged since the birth and development of nanotechnology and is based on cementitious materials additioned with carbon nanoparticles that can provide measurable electrical responses to applied strain. The response of similar transducers was mainly investigated under slowly varying strains while applications in dynamics have not been yet documented. This paper is aimed at exploring the applicability of carbon nanotube-cement based sensors for measuring dynamically varying strain in concrete structures. Experiments are presented to investigate the electrical response of prismatic specimens made of carbon nanotube-cement composite when subjected to sinusoidal stress-strains in the typical frequency range of large civil structures. The results demonstrate that the sensors' output retains all dynamic features of the input thus providing useful information for SHM and encouraging the transformation of structures into infinite sets of potential sensors with enhanced durability and limited access issues.

The percolation threshold, humidity impact on initial resistivity ({\$}\rho{\$} in ), and self-sensing piezoresistivity under mono- and cyclic-loading of the MNTCCs were correspondingly investigated. Results reveal that, the {\$}\rho{\$} in of MNTCC successively conforms to tunneling transition and percolation effect along with V increment; Fraction change in resistivity ({\$}\Delta{\$}{\$}\rho{\$}) of MNTCCs with 1.31 vol.{\%} MCNT (round percolation threshold) after excluding humidity impact can steadily and linearly alter with {\$}\sigma{\$} c or {\$}\epsilon{\$} l , and effectively reflect the microstructure changes and crack emerging; The corresponding strain sensitivity, reproducibility of the {\$}\Delta{\$}{\$}\rho{\$}-{\$}\epsilon{\$} l curve can maintain above 132, less than 5{\%}. These consequences favor the MNTCCs to be intrinsic sensors applied in infrastructure for real-time monitoring of cyclic loadings with high sensitivity, stable and fast responses.},

abstract = {In this paper, cementitious sensors were fabricated with electrostatic self-assembled carbon nanotubes (CNT)/nano carbon black (NCB) composite fillers, and embedded into concrete columns to develop smart structural components. Self-sensing properties of the sensor/smart column were evaluated under cyclic loading and monotonic loading through measuring the fractional change in resistivity (FCR) of sensor. The effect of sensor on the mechanical strength of column was also studied. Experimental results showed that whether the sensor is embedded in concrete column or not, its piezoresistivity presents high stability and repeatability under cyclic loading within the elastic regime. The relationship between stress/strain and FCR of the sensor under monotonic loading obeys polynomial formulas. As the sensor is embedded into column, regardless of the concrete strength grade is C30 or C50, the piezoresistive behavior of the embedded sensor undergoes two phases, which is different from that of the sensor before embedded. This difference between the output signal characteristics results from the Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus differences of sensor and concrete. In addition, the presence of sensor does not impact the bearing capacity of concrete column. The developed sensor is therefore suitable to be embedded into prefabricated components to make smart building products which can be calibrated for structural monitoring in real applications. {\textcopyright}2018 Elsevier Ltd},

To demonstrate this, we will refer to examples provided by pressure equipment, wind energy, aeronautical sectors, and ski lifts. Thereafter, we will focus on the context of Civil Engineering structures and examine some of the reasons for which the use of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) has not experienced the same level of growth as that seen in other industrial sectors, even if resources are available for applications, many of which are also regulated.

Smart concrete pavement made with cement based self-sensing materials could achieve in-situ monitoring for both structural integrity and traffic characteristics. This paper studied the electrical resistivity and piezoresistivity of cement with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under cyclic loading. Effects of temperature and water content on both resistivity and piezoresistivity were investigated. Test results show that the resistivity decreased as the water content increased. Differently, the piezoresistivity and change in resistance first increased and then decreased. Temperature had significant effect on resistivity and piezoresistivity. As the temperature increased, resistivity decreased but the piezoresistivity increased. The major cause of the change in resistivity and piezoresistivity was the change of tunneling conduction under different conditions. The relationship between water content, temperature and the resistivity could be accurately represented with a regression function with an R-2 of 0.92. Therefore, the data collected by self-sensing materials must be calibrated for the water content and temperature before interpretation.},

This type of material is effective in reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Addition of graphite powder increases its electric conductivity, hence, introducing new functionality to building materials such as self-sensing and self-heating properties. In this study, the effect of graphite filler on the crack initiation of alkali-activated slag composite is investigated. The graphite powder was added in the amount of 5, 10 and 15{\%} with respect to the slag mass. Beam specimens with an initial stress concentrator were tested in three-point bending at the age of 28 days. The load versus crack mouth crack opening displacement (F–CMOD) diagrams were recorded during the fracture tests and subsequently evaluated using the Double-K fracture model. This model allows the quantification of two different levels of crack propagation: initiation, which corresponds to the beginning of stable crack growth, and the level of unstable crack propagation. The course of fracture tests was also monitored by acoustic emission (AE) method.},

Different casting conditions (in situ or attached), service location (under tension or compression) and electrical contacts (embedded or superficial) were compared. Both CNFCC and CFCC were suitable as strain sensors in reversible (elastic) sensing condition testing. CNFCC showed higher sensitivities (gage factor up to 191.8), while CFCC only reached gage factors values of 178.9 (tension) or 49.5 (compression). Furthermore, damage-sensing tests were run, increasing the applied load progressively up to the RC beam failure. In these conditions, CNFCC sensors were also strain sensitive, but no damage sensing mechanism was detected for the strain levels achieved during the tests. Hence, these cement composites could act as strain sensors, even for severe damaged structures near to their collapse. {\textcopyright}2013 by the authors.},

  abstract      = {{\textcopyright}2016 Tanvir Manzur et al. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a virtually ideal reinforcing agent due to extremely high aspect ratios and ultra high strengths. It is evident from contemporary research that utilization of CNT in producing new cement-based composite materials has a great potential. Consequently, possible practical application of CNT reinforced cementitious composites has immense prospect in the field of applied nanotechnology within construction industry. Several repair, retrofit, and strengthening techniques are currently available to enhance the integrity and durability of concrete structures with cracks and spalling, but applicability and/or reliability is/are often limited. Therefore, there is always a need for innovative high performing concrete repair materials with good mechanical, rheological, and durability properties. Considering the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the test results of CNT reinforced cement composites, it is apparent that such composites could be used conveniently as concrete repair material. With this end in view, the applicability of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) reinforced cement composites as concrete repair material has been evaluated in this study in terms of setting time, bleeding, and bonding strength (slant shear) tests. It has been found that MWNT reinforced cement mortar has good prospective as concrete repair material since such composites exhibited desirable behavior in setting time, bleeding, and slant shear.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Concrete structures with various reinforcements, such as steel bars, composite material tendons, and recently steel plates, are commonly used in civil infrastructures. When an external force overcomes the strength of the bond between the reinforcement and the concrete, bond-slip will occur, resulting in a relative displacement between the reinforcing materials and the concrete. Monitoring bond health plays an important role in guaranteeing structural safety. Recently, researchers have recognized the importance of bond-slip monitoring and performed many related investigations. In this paper, a state-of-the-art review on various smart sensors based on piezoelectric effect and fiber optic technology, as well as corresponding techniques for bond-slip monitoring is presented. Since piezoelectric sensors and fiber-optic sensors are widely used in bond-slip monitoring, their principles and relevant monitoring methods are also introduced in this paper. Particularly, the piezoelectric-based bond-slip monitoring methods including the active sensing method, the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) method and the passive sensing using acoustic emission (AE) method, and the fiber-optic-based bond-slip detecting approaches including the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and the distributed fiber optic sensing are highlighted. This paper provides guidance for practical applications and future development of bond-slip monitoring.},

abstract = {The paper proposes the novel concept of smart bricks as a durable sensing solution for structural health monitoring of masonry structures. The term smart bricks denotes piezoresistive clay bricks with suitable electronics capable of outputting measurable changes in their electrical properties under changes in their state of strain. This feature can be exploited to evaluate stress at critical locations inside a masonry wall and to detect changes in loading paths associated with structural damage, for instance following an earthquake. Results from an experimental campaign show that normal clay bricks, fabricated in the laboratory with embedded electrodes made of a special steel for resisting the high baking temperature, exhibit a quite linear and repeatable piezoresistive behavior. That is a change in electrical resistance proportional to a change in axial strain. In order to be able to exploit this feature for strain sensing, high-resolution electronics are used with a biphasic DC measurement approach to eliminate any resistance drift due to material polarization. Then, an enhanced nanocomposite smart brick is proposed, where titania is mixed with clay before baking, in order to enhance the brick's mechanical properties, improve its noise rejection, and increase its electrical conductivity. Titania was selected among other possible conductive nanofillers due to its resistance to high temperatures and its ability to improve the durability of construction materials while maintaining the aesthetic appearance of clay bricks. An application of smart bricks for crack detection in masonry walls is demonstrated by laboratory testing of a small-scale wall specimen under different loading conditions and controlled damage. Overall, it is demonstrated that a few strategically placed smart bricks enable monitoring of the state of strain within the wall and provide information that is capable of crack detection.},

abstract = {The widespread application of sophisticated structural health monitoring systems in civil infrastructures produces a large volume of data. As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learning–based data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy. {\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2018.},

In particular, innovative construction materials with multifunctional enhanced properties can be produced. The paper presents an experimental characterization on cement-matrix pastes doped with Carbon Nanotubes, Carbon Nanofibers, Carbon Black and Graphene Nanoplatelets. Both electro-mechanical and thermo-physical investigations have been carried out. The conductive nanoinclusions provide the cementitious matrix with piezoresistive properties allowing the detection of external strain and stress changes. Thereby, traditional building materials, such as concrete and cementitious materials in general, would be capable of self-monitoring the state of deformation they are subject to, giving rise to diffuse sensing systems of structural integrity. Besides supplying self-sensing abilities, carbon nanofillers may change mechanical, physical and thermal properties of cementitious composites. The experimental tests of the research have been mainly concentrated on the thermal conductivity and the optical properties of the different nanomodified materials, in order to make a critical comparison between them. The aim of the work is the characterization of an innovative multifunctional composite capable of combining self-monitoring properties with proper mechanical and thermal-energy efficiency characteristics.

abstract = {In recent years, self-sensing structural materials have drawn enormous attention of scientific community due to their potential to enable continuous monitoring of the integrity of structures. The new paradigm of smart condition-based maintenance advocates the use of next-generation structures completely or partly constituted by self-sensing materials, that is, the structure or part of it also behaves as a sensor. In this context, the remarkable mechanical and electrical properties of multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have fostered an increasing number of applications as fillers for composites with multifunctional properties. Among a wide spectrum of potential applications, the development of skin-type piezoresistive distributed strain sensors shows great promise. Such sensors can be deployed onto large-scale structures, enabling a continuous monitoring of the strain state in the global area of the structure. In this paper, a theoretical study on the potential application of smart MWCNT/epoxy strip-like strain sensors for damage detection/localization/quantification in reinforced concrete (RC) beams is presented. A micromechanics-based finite element model is proposed for the electromechanical analysis of MWCNT/epoxy strips. Furthermore, a damage detection algorithm through model updating approach is introduced. To do so, an Euler-Bernoulli model for beams equipped with a smart MWCNT/epoxy strip is developed. Finally, two numerical case studies are presented including: a 2D concrete beam with multiple prescribed crack-like damages, and a 3D RC beam under four-point flexural conditions with non-prescribed cracking. Results show that the proposed smart strips are capable of exploiting the damage-induced variations in the electrical output to locate and quantify damages for real-time distributed structural health monitoring of RC beam structures. {\textcopyright}2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A novel vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) approach that uses two-dimensional deep convolution neural networks (CNN) is introduced. The CNN extracts the features from acceleration response histories and drastically reduces the dimension of response history to make damage state classification possible with limited number of acceleration measurements. The proposed method was validated, and its applicability and efficiency were demonstrated using vibration response data recorded during the shake-table testing of a one-fourth–scale model of a reinforced concrete highway bridge. The proposed method predicted predefined damage states with 100{\%} accuracy using recorded (acceleration) vibration response data. The method was shown to be robust and sensitive to very small changes in structural condition. It is also noted that the CNN-based SHM method is scalable to any large number of damage states (including extent and location) with suitable network training. The required training data may be generated analytically using a nonlinear finite element model. {\textcopyright}2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2019. Prestressed concrete sleepers with built-in fibre optic–based sensing systems have recently been developed to capture performance data within railway networks and to provide critical decision-support information to route managers and operators. To better understand how self-sensing sleepers can be fully utilized within the rail network, a study of their comprehensive performance under controlled conditions must be undertaken. This article presents the results of the full-scale laboratory testing of a self-sensing sleeper supported on ballast. A primary focus of this study was to investigate whether a self-sensing sleeper could also be used to estimate rail seat load, detect cracking, and identify differential ballast settlement. The ultimate capacity and resilience of the embedded fiber Bragg grating sensing system was tested by applying load up until concrete cracking followed by several cyclic load cycles. Through inference of the load versus strain response, the ability of the self-sensing sleeper to detect damage (concrete cracking and loss of ballast support) was evaluated. The experimental results revealed the effectiveness and robustness of the embedded sensing system to continue to provide reliable dynamic strain measurements well beyond the ultimate loading capacity of the prestressed sleeper. Cracking of the top surface of the sleeper was effectively detected by the fiber Bragg grating strain sensors at the mid-span section. After cracking, subsequent load cycles were carried out. During this period, the bottom fiber Bragg grating measurements captured the effects of differential ballast settlement under the rail seats. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model was developed to simulate the experimental test setup and to investigate the relation between fiber Bragg grating sensor measurements and rail track response. The combined experimental and numerical results suggest that a self-sensing sleeper may be deployed on an operational railway to provide reliable and long-term measurements of rail axle load and ballast pressure.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have excellent mechanical properties and have the potential, if combined with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), traditionally a brittle material in tension, to become a nano-composite with superlative mechanical properties. However, highly attractive van der Waals forces between CNTs create coherent agglomerates that prove difficult to disperse within the cement matrix and reduce the fluidity of the fresh mixture. Good dispersion of CNTs, while maintaining good workability of fresh OPC-CNT paste mixtures, is a prequalification before CNT-cement nanocomposites can be considered as a future building and construction material with enhanced mechanical properties. This paper reports the results of investigations of the dispersion, workability, and strength of CNT aqueous and CNT-OPC paste mixtures, with and without several generically different dispersants/surfactants that are compatible as admixtures in the manufacture of concrete. These include an air entrainer, styrene butadiene rubber, polycarboxylates, calcium naphthalene sulfonate, and lignosulfonate formulations. Aqueous mixtures were initially assessed for dispersion of CNTs, followed by workability testing of selected OPC-CNT-dispersant/surfactant paste mixtures. A broad range of workability responses were measured and the CNT dispersion within hardened pastes was qualitatively assessed by SEM analysis. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Reinforced concrete is of vital importance in many civil and industrial structural applications. The effective bonding between steel and concrete is the core guarantee of the safe operation of the structures. Corrosion or other interface debonding in steel-concrete is a typical failure mode during the long service period of the structures, which can severely reduce the load-bearing capacity. The Non-destructive Evaluation technique has been applied to civil engineering structures in recent years. This paper investigates the evaluation of reinforced concrete structures that have interface defects, including the cross-sectional loss and cracks, by using the piezoceramic induced ultrasonic wave and time reversal method. Ultrasonic wave is used as actuating wave to obtain the signals with defect information. Time reversal method is applied to localize and characterize defect along the interface of the steel-concrete and to image the defect through the cross-sectional scanning. Experiments were conducted to perform Nondestructive Evaluation by using six reinforced concrete components with different levels of defects. The invisible damages were made by the cutting part of the steel and embedding a table tennis ball inside concrete structures. The results show that the time reversed method can locate and evaluate the defects along the steel reinforced concrete, and the obtained defect images at the cross-section of the concrete structure are accurate.},

The monitoring aims of this unique program were to increase safety, verify performance, control quality, increase knowledge, optimize maintenance costs, and evaluate the condition of the structures after a hazardous event. The first instrumented building, which has now been monitored for more than ten years, is presented in this paper. The long-gauge fiber optic strain sensors were embedded in fresh concrete of ground-level columns, thus the monitoring started at the birth of both the construction material and the structure. Measurement sessions were performed during construction, upon completion of each new story and the roof, and after the construction, i.e., in-service. Based on results it was possible to follow and evaluate long-term behavior of the building through every stage of its life. The results of monitoring were analyzed at a local (column) and global (building) level. Over-dimensioning of one column was identified. Differential settlement of foundations was detected, localized, and its magnitude estimated. Post-tremor analysis was performed. Real long-term behavior of concrete columns was assessed. Finally, the long-term performance of the monitoring system was evaluated. The researched monitoring method, monitoring system, rich results gathered over approximately ten years, data analysis algorithms, and the conclusions on the structural behavior and health condition of the building based on monitoring are presented in this paper. {\textcopyright}2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Moreover, the quantitative analysis of signal noise in FCI-COD curves has been accomplished by the fractal geometry method. The result shows that a monotonic linearity and bi-linearity increasing relationship between FCI and COD can be observed for beams with deflection-softening (Group A and Group B specimens) and deflection-hardening (Group C specimens) behavior, respectively.

abstract = {Concrete structures undergo an uncontrollable damage process manifesting in the form of cracks due to the coupling of fatigue loading and environmental effects. In order to achieve long-term durability and performance, continuous health monitoring systems are needed to make critical decisions regarding operation, maintenance and repairs. Recent advances in nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes have opened the door for new smart and advanced sensing materials that could effectively be used in health monitoring of structures where wireless and real time sensing could provide information on damage development. In this paper, carbon nanotube networks were embedded into a cement matrix to develop an in situ wireless and embedded sensor for damage detection in concrete structures. By wirelessly measuring the change in the electrical resistance of the carbon nanotube networks, the progress of damage can be detected and monitored. As a proof of concept, wireless cement-carbon nanotube sensors were embedded into concrete beams and subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading to evaluate the effect of damage on their response. Experimental results showed that the wireless response of the embedded nanotube sensors changes due to the formation of cracks during loading. In addition, the nanotube sensors were able to detect the initiation of damage at an early stage of loading.},

abstract = {Computer games are real-time applications that create interactive virtual environments, usually as discrete time-stepped simulations. These simulations may have predefined time step sizes or may use variable time step sizes. These approaches are common in games, but not flexible. In the first approach, when the game runs on a machine with abundant resources, the game does not use the extra capacity to improve simulation quality (task results or presentation). The second approach usually runs the simulation as fast as possible, using the time elapsed between consecutive time steps to scale all computations, so as the simulation runs in real-time. However, this approach wastes processor time and energy and in multi-core hardware scenarios (e.g., GPUs and clusters), the problem of wasting computing resources becomes more severe. In this paper, we propose a parallel and adaptive architecture that employs tardiness policy in multi-core hardware to handle the aforementioned issues. The architecture uses tardiness policy to monitor and change task behavior according to the current conditions of he host hardware. On more powerful computers, the architecture is able to improve task quality if there is spare time available. On less powerful computers, the architecture restricts task functionality so that tasks are able to complete on time. We provide two examples to demonstrate how the architecture works.},

In order to optimize the parameters of the nickel powder-filled cement-based sensors, effect of size, electrode separation and surface roughness of sensors on stress/strain compatibility between sensors and their surrounding concrete was investigated with finite element software ANSYS. The stress states of the optimized nickel powder-filled cement-based sensors and their surrounding concrete was analyzed when the sensors embedded in concrete. The results show that the suitable size and electrode separation of the sensors are 20mm×20mm×40mm and 5mm respectively. The surface of sensors should be as rough as possible. The sensors are nearly subjected to a uniaxial stress state when they are embedded in concrete. The stresses of the sensors and their surrounding concrete are quite different, As the strain is compatible, the testing results of sensors need to be modified for ensuring test accuracy when the sensors are used for health monitoring of concrete structures.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT)/cement composites have been proposed as a multifunctional material for self sensing and traffic monitoring due to their unique electric conductivity which changes with the application of mechanical load. However, material constituent and environmental factors may significantly affect the potential application of these materials. Therefore, it is necessary to understand an influence of material constituent such as porosity and dispersion of CNT and environmental factor such as moisture on the electrical conductivity of CNT/cement composite. This paper investigates the effect of moisture on the effective electrical conductivity of CNT/cement composites. To prepare the specimens, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are well dispersed in cement paste, which is then molded and cured into cubic test specimens. By drying the specimens from the fully saturated state to the fully dry state, the effective electrical conductivity is measured at different moisture contents. As the water in the specimen is replaced by air voids, the electrical conductivity significantly decreases. Different ratios of MWCNTs to cement have been Used in this study. Micromechanical models have been used to predict the effective electrical conductivities. A comprehensive model is proposed to take into account the effects of individual material phases on the effective electrical conductivity of CNT/cement composites with moisture effect.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 Elsevier B.V. The feasibility of achieving self strain and damage sensing in an ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) mixture by incorporating micro steel fibers and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was investigated. Based on a preliminary study, the volume content of the CNTs was determined to be 0.5{\%}, and 2{\%} (by volume) micro steel fibers were included in the mixture to fabricate ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) that is similar to a commercially available product. Dog-bone specimens were fabricated using UHPC and UHPFRC with CNTs to evaluate the tensile performance and their self-sensing capability. Digital image correlation (DIC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also adopted to precisely analyze their mechanical and electrical properties. Test results indicated that the hybrid use of steel fibers and CNTs provided a significant improvement in tensile performance, including strength and post-peak ductility, compared to the use of CNTs alone. Crack bridging by CNTs was not achieved in the UHPC mixture, resulting in brittle tensile failure. Severe signal noise in the fractional change in resistance (FCR) and very high electrical resistance were observed in UHPC with CNTs, whereas very smooth FCR data with minor noise and much smaller resistance were obtained in the UHPFRC with CNTs. Furthermore, both pre- and post-peak tensile performance of UHPFRC with CNTs were well simulated based on the measured FCR with a high coefficient of determination (greater than 0.9). Consequently, the use of both steel fibers and CNTs in a UHPC mixture was recommended to improve post-cracking tensile performance and self strain and damage sensing capabilities.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effect of nanomaterials on the piezoresistive sensing capacity of cement-based composites. Three different nanomaterials—multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphite nanofibers, and graphene oxide—were considered along with a plain mortar, and a cyclic compressive test was performed. Based on a preliminary test, the optimum flowability was determined to be 150 mm in terms of fiber dispersion. The electrical resistivity of the composites substantially decreased by incorporating 1 wt{\%} multi-walled carbon nanotubes, but only slightly decreased by including 1 wt{\%} graphite nanofibers and graphene oxide. This indicates that the use of multi-walled carbon nanotubes is most effective in improving the conductivity of the composites compared to the use of graphite nanofibers and graphene oxide. The fractional change in resistivity of the composites with nanomaterials exhibited similar behavior to that of the cyclic compressive load, but partial reversibility in fractional change in resistivity was obtained beyond 60{\%} of the peak load. A linear relationship between the fractional change in resistivity and cyclic compression strain (up to 1500 {\$}\mu{\$}{\$}\epsilon{\$}) was observed in the composites with multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and the gauge factor was found to be 166.6. It is concluded that cement-based composites with 1 wt{\%} multi-walled carbon nanotubes can be used as piezoresistive sensors for monitoring the stress/strain generated in concrete structures.},

abstract = {Within the novel approach for structural health monitoring of civil engineering structures based on smart self-sensing structural materials, Carbon NanoTube (CNT)-reinforced cement-based composites, often termed “smart concretes” have drawn rising interest. These composites exhibit self-sensing capabilities resulting in measurable variations of their electrical properties under applied mechanical deformations. This, along with the similarity between these composites and conventional structural concrete, makes it possible to devise cost-efficient distributed monitoring systems for large-scale Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures. While several papers in the literature have focused on pilot applications of smart concrete strain sensors embedded into large RC components, the response of these sensors is not yet fully understood at the fundamental physical level and, as a consequence, their output is not properly interpreted. In order to shed some light on this issue, previous work by the authors focused on laterally unconstrained uni-axial loading conditions. This work extends the previous studies by presenting a mixed micromechanics and finite element approach for the analysis of CNT-reinforced composites subjected to arbitrary strain states. The two mechanisms that contribute to the electrical conductivity of CNT-reinforced composites, namely electron hopping and conductive networking, are contemplated within a percolation framework in the micromechanics model. On the basis of the micromechanics model, the 3D piezoresistivity matrix is determined, for the first time in the literature, by means of virtual dilation and distortion tests. Afterwards, the electro-mechanical modeling of three-dimensional composite elements is conducted by a multi-physics finite element code. The potential of the presented approach is illustrated by extensive parametric analyses, as well as a comparison against experimental data, including application of the mixed micromechanics-finite-element multi-physics formulation for electro-mechanical modeling of three-dimensional elements. {\textcopyright}2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Service life estimation and extension of civil engineering structures provides valuable information on the development and use of newer and more durable materials and methods of construction, as well as the development and use of new techniques of estimating service life. Part one discusses using fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites to extend the service-life of civil engineering structures. It considers the key issues in the use of FRP composites, examines the possibility of extending the service life of structurally deficient and deteriorating concrete structures and investigates the uncertainties of using FRP composites in the rehabilitation of civil engineering structures.

This study examined the electrical and self-sensing capacities of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) with and without carbon nanotubes (CNTs). For this, the effects of steel fiber content, orientation, and pore water content on the electrical and piezoresistive properties of UHPFRC without CNTs were first evaluated. Then, the effect of CNT content on the self-sensing capacities of UHPFRC under compression and flexure was investigated. Test results indicated that higher steel fiber content, better fiber orientation, and higher amount of pore water led to higher electrical conductivity of UHPFRC. The effects of fiber orientation and drying condition on the electrical conductivity became minor as sufficiently high amount of steel fibers, 3{\%} by volume, was added. Including only steel fibers did not impart UHPFRC with piezoresistive properties. Addition of CNTs substantially improved the electrical conductivity of UHPFRC. Under compression, UHPFRC with a CNT content of 0.3{\%} or greater had a self-sensing ability that was activated by the formation of cracks, and better sensing capacity was achieved by including greater amount of CNTs. Furthermore, the pre-peak flexural behavior of UHPFRC was precisely simulated with a fractional change in resistivity when 0.3{\%} CNTs were incorporated. The pre-cracking self-sensing capacity of UHPFRC with CNTs was more effective under tensile stress state than under compressive stress state.},

  abstract  = {Cement-based smart sensors appear particularly suitable for monitoring applications, due to their self-sensing abilities, their ease of use, and their numerous possible field applications. The addition of conductive carbon nanofillers into a cementitious matrix provides the material with piezoresistive characteristics and enhanced sensitivity to mechanical alterations. The strain-sensing ability is achieved by correlating the variation of external loads or deformations with the variation of specific electrical parameters, such as the electrical resistance. Among conductive nanofillers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown promise for the fabrication of self-monitoring composites. However, some issues related to the filler dispersion and the mix design of cementitious nanoadded materials need to be further investigated. For instance, a small difference in the added quantity of a specific nanofiller in a cement-matrix composite can substantially change the quality of the dispersion and the strain sensitivity of the resulting material. The present research focuses on the strain sensitivity of concrete, mortar and cement paste sensors fabricated with different amounts of carbon nanotube inclusions. The aim of the work is to investigate the quality of dispersion of the CNTs in the aqueous solutions, the physical properties of the fresh mixtures, the electromechanical properties of the hardened materials, and the sensing properties of the obtained transducers. Results show that cement-based sensors with CNT inclusions, if properly implemented, can be favorably applied to structural health monitoring.},

@article{Garcia-Macias2017b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016 Elsevier Ltd The incorporation of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) as nanoinclusions for the development of electrically conductive cement-based composites opens a vast range of possibilities for monitoring of concrete structures. A key issue for the design and optimization of these composites is the development of theoretical models capable of providing a quantitative prediction of their overall electrical conductivity. Experimental results have evidenced the strong influence of the waviness and dispersion of the nanotubes on the overall conductivity of these materials, what makes the consideration of these two phenomena essential for the development of realistic theoretical models. Nevertheless, both waviness and agglomeration have been often neglected in the literature or, when considered, have been reproduced with very simple modeling approaches not suitable to catch the complexity of the problem at hand. This paper presents an improved micromechanics model of the effective electrical conductivity of CNT cement-based nanocomposites based on enhanced approaches for reproducing waviness and non-uniform spatial distributions of the nanoinclusions. The two mechanisms that govern the electrical conductivity of these composites, electron hopping and conductive networks, are incorporated in the mixed micromechanics model. On the basis of scanning electron microscopy inspections, a helical waviness model and a two-parameter agglomeration approach are proposed. In order to assess the accuracy of the proposed analytical model, cement-based specimens have been manufactured and tested for providing data to use as the basis of comparison. In particular, specimens of cement pastes, mortars and concretes with different concentrations of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been prepared. It is shown that the consideration of straight uniformly distributed nanotubes, as typically done in the literature, leads to an overestimation of the overall conductivity. On the contrary, it is highlighted that the wavy state of the fibers as well as their agglomeration in bundles play a crucial role in the conductivity of cement-based nanocomposites, which is demonstrated by achieving a good fit to the experimental data when using the proposed models for waviness and agglomeration. Overall, the paper highlights the physical mechanisms governing the overall electrical conductivity of cement-based composites with MWCNTs and provides a powerful analytical tool for their design.},

abstract = {Strain-sensing functions of Portland cement pastes with different dosages of carbon nanotubes (CNT) are systematically studied. This is one of the relevant functions that multifunctional composites are able to develop when a conductive addition is included in the cement matrix. Strain sensing refers to the ability of a structural material to sense its own condition, such as strain or stress, through the piezoresistive behaviour (change of volume electrical resistivity when it is subjected to a force). CNTs, which possess exceptional electromechanical properties, are considered as a promising addition for practical applications such as structural health and load monitoring. Nevertheless, there is still an important challenge regarding CNT cement composite fabrication: achieving their effective dispersion. This point is addressed by means of a comparison between different physical and chemical dispersion methods. The technique used for that purpose is light-scattering particle size analysis. After selecting the optimal dispersing procedure, the effect on the strain-sensing properties of CNT reinforced cement pastes was studied for the following variables: CNT dosage, curing age, current intensity, loading rate and maximum stress applied. All these parameters are discussed taking gauge factor value as the reference.},

abstract = {The flexural stress/crack sensing capabilities of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT)/cement composite sensors were investigated in this study. The electrical/mechanical characteristics of the composites were explored with respect to the MWNT contents, prior to evaluating the sensing capabilities of the composites. A dramatic increase (over three orders) in the electrical conductivity, compressive and flexural strength (36{\%} and 18{\%}) were observed in the composite specimens. The sensing capabilities of the composites were evaluated by monitoring the electrical resistance change of the composites under loading. The composites subjected to flexural stress showed higher sensing capability as the MWNT content was increased. Both stress and crack sensing capability were enhanced with the increase of MWNT content. In addition, the examination demonstrated that an embedment of MWNT content of 0.6 wt{\%} resulted in the best sensing capabilities. Lastly, the composites were embedded in two different locations of reinforced mortar beams for in-situ monitoring of electrical resistance. A dramatic change in the resistance of the composites were accompanied at failure of the mortar, regardless of the sensor location. The obtained result may have implications for the use of the composites as a stress/crack sensor in cement-based composite structures.},

The results show that the percolation occurs and polarization disappears in SSSW reinforced RPC containing 0.5 vol{\%} of SSSW in diameter of 20 mu m, and the electrical resistivity of which measured by using four-electrode-DC method drops to 44 Omega cm from 20.8 x 10(4) Omega cm. The gauge factor of RPC reinforced with SSSW in diameter of 8 mu m can reach up to 22.5, 94.9 and 43.6 under cyclic compression, monotonic compression and flexure, respectively.

abstract = {Novel nanocomposite smart multifunctional materials are emerging as promising technological advances in construction industry, where thermal-energy efficiency needs should meet environmental sustainability and mechanical performance requirements. In this view, new cement-based materials showed encouraging results in terms of added functional properties combining all the above mentioned capabilities with electrical conductivity and self-sensing potential for a variety of field scopes, e.g. vibration measurements, damage detection, structural health monitoring, electromagnetic shielding, self-heating pavements for deicing and more. The present paper deals with the development and multipurpose experimental characterization of cement-based materials doped with different carbon nanoinclusions consisting of: multi-walled carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon black, and graphene nanoplatelets. The study investigates morphology, optical features, thermal characteristics, electrical properties and strain-sensing capability of the different composites, through a campaign of in-lab experimental measurements. The results highlight the peculiar behavior of each composite material, which is strictly related to the adopted nanoinclusions, that reveal to be suitable for specific purposes. In particular, all carbon nanoinclusions are seen to reduce solar reflectance capability, while they produce negligible variations in thermal emittance. Graphene nanoplatelets represent the most effective nanoinclusion to increase thermal conductivity and diffusivity, which is related to their structural and geometrical characteristics and better capability to distribute the thermal wave. Consistently, the same graphene samples produce the largest electrical conductivity and capacitance. However, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, even though providing comparatively smaller contributions to electrical conductivity, are seen to be the best nanoinclusions for providing strain sensing capabilities to the cement-based composites.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 Elsevier Ltd This paper reports on the influence of using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on flexural strength recovery of heat-damaged RC beams repaired with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. Twenty-two RC beams were prepared, heated at 500 °C and 600 °C, repaired, and then subjected to four-point loading. The nanotubes were incorporated in the composite systems by either using CNT-modified epoxy resin and/or CNT-modified sizing agent. The flexural behavior was characterized based on failure mode, crack patterns, and load-displacement response. The morphology of the fractured surfaces and interfaces were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Experimental results revealed that the addition of CNT enhances the capability of the composites to recover the flexural load capacity and stiffness of heat-damaged beams. The improvement depends on the level of damage of the heated beams. SEM images showed that adding CNTs enhanced the interface adhesion between carbon fiber, epoxy, and concrete. This enhancement facilitated the load transfer thus the efficiency of the repair technique.},

An experimental study was carried out to understand the electrical percolation thresholds of different carbon-based nano- and micro-scale materials in cementitious composites. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and carbon black (CB) were selected as the nano-scale materials, while 6 and 12 mm long carbon fibers (CF6 and CF12) were used as the micro-scale carbon-based materials. After determining the percolation thresholds of different electrical conductive materials, mechanical properties and piezoresistive properties of specimens produced with the abovementioned conductive materials at percolation threshold were investigated under uniaxial compressive loading. Results demonstrate that regardless of initial curing age, the percolation thresholds of CNT, GNP, CB and CFs in ECC mortar specimens were around 0.55{\%}, 2.00{\%}, 2.00{\%} and 1.00{\%}, respectively. Including different carbon-based conductive materials did not harm compressive strength results; on the contrary, it improved overall values. All cementitious composites produced with carbon-based materials, with the exception of the control mixtures, exhibited piezoresistive behavior under compression, which is crucial for sensing capability. It is believed that incorporating the sensing attribute into cementitious composites will enhance benefits for sustainable civil infrastructures.},

Falling-offs of parts of deteriorated structures were often reported and sometimes caused casualties in Japan and many other countries. When an earthquake occurs, in particular, deteriorated structures have higher possibility to be damaged or collapsed. Thus assessing the health condition of structures is one of the important topics in civil engineering. Considering a large number of structures that have been in service more than 40 years in Japan, efficient evaluation methods are requested. In this regard, non-destructive tests have high possibility to be applied to various structures without affecting their functions. Accordingly, this study focuses on the use of infrared thermography to detect internal deterioration of concrete structures. As a first step of investigation, thermography diagnosis, hammer sounding test and Schmidt rebound hammer test were carried out to detect internal deterioration of a concrete retaining wall located in the campus of Chiba University, Chiba, Japan, and the results were compared to evaluate the capability and accuracy of these diagnosis methods.},

abstract = {The paper presents the development results of "smart" pressure-sensitive fibre-cement compositematerials as well as thin-film coating sensors designed to detect disruptions of the base materialstructure. Basic material characteristics of fine-grained and coarse-grained cement matrices wereacquired during the research. The benefits and influence of conductive inorganic components,metallic components in the form of iron fillings and steel wires, and last but not least carbon-basednon-metallic fibrous reinforcement, have been verified. Thin-film epoxy resin coatings were enrichedwith amorphous carbon black, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and natural micronizedgraphite. The article closely describes the measurement of electrical and electro-mechanical(piezoresistive) properties of conductive fibre-cement composites and thin-film organic coatings in anon-loaded state, during static loading and especially during dynamic ballistic and shock tests on thefall tower. Specific electrical characteristics and the course of change in electric conductivity wasexpressed as electrical resistivity (the real component of the impedance).The performed experiments confirmed excellent electrical conductivity of dense steel-fibrereinforced composites and graphite-doped hybrid fibre reinforced concrete. The coatings showedsignificant and permanent changes in impedance in the order of tens of ohms. The newly developedfibre composites and coating layers change the impedance during destructive and non-destructivedynamic loading tests. The impedance changed not only during failure of the matrix, but also in thecase of indirect impact. Moreover, carbon reinforced concrete with incorporated graphite showedsome piezoresistive properties. These detection materials were intended to be part of a ballistic-resistant monitoring system.},

While previous studies were focused on the incorporation of CNTs solely into the cement matrix, this paper is aimed at investigating the self-sensing capability of CNTs in steel-reinforced concrete. The beam specimens were subjected simultaneously to a third-point load test, a four-point probe Test, and strain measurement. It was established that the CNT network exhibited conductivity inside the concrete and was able to translate applied stresses to varying resistance readings. An increasing trend in resistivity was found in concrete specimens while fluctuating readings were obtained from steel-reinforced specimens. This is due to the presence of the rebar which requires special detail. Furthermore, a significant increase of 13.6{\%} and 40{\%} in the flexural and compressive strengths, respectively, were observed. Thus, the application of CNTs in new concrete structures, as well as repaired structures, has a significant contribution in the advancement of smart buildings.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Uniform dispersion of the incorporated MWCNTs in the nanocomposites was achieved using a novel preparation method that involved powder mixing and in situ polymerization. Promoted and retarded results at the percolation threshold were observed, and the trend strongly depended on the surface treatment of the MWCNTs, such as acid, hydrogen peroxide and heat treatments. The electrical percolation behavior of nanocomposites with surface treated MWCNTs has been a controversial topic in the literature. The defect and resistivity of MWCNTs, which were expected to be important physical factors that influence the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites, were found to have only a minor influence. Different functionalities of the MWCNTs after surface treatments altered the dispersion state of the incorporated MWCNTs in the nanocomposites, and the dispersion state was the dominant physical factor that governed the electrical percolation behavior of the nanocomposites. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring has become a viable solution to monitor critical infrastructure components that show distress or are unable to pass current load ratings. This research introduces the concept of a composite layer bonded to concrete structures, which is capable of providing distributed sensing capabilities. The layer consists of carbon nanotubes that are deposited on a carrier, which form a continuous conductive skin that is exceptionally sensitive to changes in strain and the formation and propagation of micro-damage and macro-damage. It can be either structural, where the layer represents the reinforcement as well as the sensor, or nonstructural, where the layer acts as a sensing skin alone. Distributed sensing allows for increased detectability of forming or growing damage that cannot necessarily be captured with conventional point-type sensors such as strain gages or accelerometers. Once developed, this sensing skin may be able to give real-time feedback on changes in strain, temperature effects, and formation and propagation of damage. In this article, we present the fabrication and evaluation of an integrated structural sensing composite layer attached to a concrete beam specimen. The specimen was tested to failure in the laboratory. Experimental results are presented and discussed, and currently ongoing research is introduced. {\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2013.},

@article{Agnisarman2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 Elsevier B.V. Routine inspection and maintenance are critical for the proper functioning of civil infrastructures such as bridges, pavements and underground structures. Civil infrastructures are being inspected less frequently because of the high cost and long duration of current inspection procedures. Furthermore, conventional inspection procedures often interrupt the routine functioning of the infrastructure, are inspector-dependent and expose the inspectors to complex and unsafe working environments. Visual inspection technologies play a crucial role in the inspection and maintenance of civil infrastructures. Automation-assisted technologies such as drones and underwater vehicles equipped with multiple imaging and sensing systems have been developed to address some of these issues with the conventional visual inspection processes. This paper reviews peer-reviewed research publications investigating automated visual inspection technologies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Specifically, 53 publications satisfying a set of inclusion criteria were reviewed, its results highlighting the application domain, the level of autonomy of the automated systems, the sensor technologies used for the inspection process and navigation, the navigation and control technologies and the algorithms used. The review of the articles revealed that the data collected by automation is used to augment the qualitative assessment. Several types of algorithms such as target detection and image enhancing have been developed to reduce the inspector bias in these automated technologies. Path planning algorithms reduce the workload on the inspector by automating the navigation and control tasks. Remotely operated systems reduce the risk to the inspectors by minimizing their exposure to the inspection environment. However, only a limited number of studies investigated the human factors aspects of the automation-assisted inspection process. It is important to understand the cognitive, physical, and temporal demands these technologies place on inspectors to improve the design of systems assisting in the inspection process. Moreover, factors such as automation bias, trust in the system and communication between the automation and the operator need to be investigated. Furthermore, it is important to incorporate appropriate decision aids that support adequate situation awareness in the interface design. Based on these findings this review proposes directions for future research. This review concludes by highlighting the need for human-centered research to develop better solutions for infrastructure inspection problems.},

The paper is aimed at investigating the use of embedded smart concrete sensors for monitoring the strain in full-scale reinforced concrete beams. The new sensors are made of the same matrix material of the concrete elements to be monitored and can be easily embedded into structural components before casting, thus achieving a durable and distributed sensing solution for structural health monitoring purposes. The self-monitoring ability is obtained through the dispersion of nano-metric conductive carbon-based fillers which induce new piezoresistive properties. In this study, a set of smart concrete sensors was embedded on top of a simply supported reinforced concrete beam and the dynamic performance of the element was evaluated, by measuring the variation in electrical resistance of the smart concrete sensors and benchmarked against measurements carried out with traditional strain gauges. The results of such comparisons demonstrate that the new sensors are apt for strain monitoring in RC structural components.},

abstract = {This paper characterised the piezoresistive properties of carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced cementitious composites. Such factors as curing conditions, carboxyl functionalisation, water/ cement ratio and oven drying were considered in the experiment and their effects on the piezoresistive sensitivity were experimentally investigated. Experimental results indicate that the electronic resistance of the CNT reinforced composites cured in a dry environment is negatively correlated with compressive loads. Furthermore, the functionalisation of CNT with carboxyl has beneficial effects on the piezoresistive response of the composites. However, neither moist cured composites nor the composites with a water/cement ratio of 0 5 show the piezoresistive behaviour, while the oven dried composites exhibit the highest piezoresistive sensitivity. This study indicates that the moisture content in the composite is the most important factor in developing the piezoresistive properties of CNT reinforced composites. With decreasing moisture content in the composites, the piezoresistive sensitivity is enhanced. It is expected that the piezoresistive properties of CNT reinforced composites can be efficiently used in developing a new type of sensor for the structural health monitoring of concrete structures. {\textcopyright}2014 W.

abstract = {The resistive behavior of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/epoxy resins, tested under mechanical cycles and different levels of applied strain, was investigated for specimens loaded in axial tension. The surface normalized resistivity is linear with the strain for volume fraction of MWCNTs between 2.96×10−4 and 2.97×10−3 (0.05 and 0.5{\%} wt/wt). For values lower than 0.05{\%} wt/wt, close to the electrical percolation threshold (EPT) a non-linear behavior was observed. The strain sensitivity, in the range between 0.67 and 4.45, may be specifically modified by controlling the nanotube loading, in fact the sensor sensitivity decreases with increasing the carbon nanotubes amount. Microscale damages resulted directly related to the resistance changes and hence easily detectable in a non-destructive way by means of electrical measurements. In the fatigue tests, the damage is expressed through the presence of a residual resistivity, which increases with the amount of plastic strain accumulated in the matrix.},

abstract = {We apply continuum connectedness percolation theory to realistic carbon nanotube systems and predict how bending flexibility, length polydispersity, and attractive interactions between them influence the percolation threshold, demonstrating that it can be used as a predictive tool for designing nanotube-based composite materials. We argue that the host matrix in which the nanotubes are dispersed controls this threshold through the interactions it induces between them during processing and through the degree of connectedness that must be set by the tunneling distance of electrons, at least in the context of conductivity percolation. This provides routes to manipulate the percolation threshold and the level of conductivity in the final product. We find that the percolation threshold of carbon nanotubes is very sensitive to the degree of connectedness, to the presence of small quantities of longer rods, and to very weak attractive interactions between them. Bending flexibility or tortuosity, on the other hand, has only a fairly weak impact on the percolation threshold.},

abstract = {This study proposes a multi-channel electrical impedance-based crack localization technique of fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (FRCCs) under bending conditions. FRCCs have a self-sensing capability by adding conductive steel fibers into nonconductive cementitious composites, making it possible to measure electrical impedance without sensor installation. Moreover, FRCCs materials can be used as a structural member thanks to its own enhanced structural ductility as well as stiffness. In a structural health monitoring point of view, these characteristics make FRCCs suitable for monitoring structural hot spots, particularly where the crack is most likely to be initiated. Since the electrical impedance obtained from FRCCs is typically sensitive to environmental and operational conditions, false alarms are often triggered. The proposed technique can minimize the false alarms by using currently measured multi-path data as well as localize a crack within the sensing range. To examine the feasibility of crack localization in FRCCs, an instantaneous multi-channel electrical impedance acquisition system and a crack localization algorithm are developed. Subsequently, three-point bending tests are carried out under various temperature conditions. The validation test results reveal that cracks are successfully identified and localized even under varying temperature conditions. {\textcopyright}2018 by the authors.},

Carbon nanotubes can be added to cementitious materials to create a multifunctional nanocomposite with excellent piezoresistive and strain-sensing properties. The use of carbon nanotubes provides high strain sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, which are ideal for fabricating self-sensing nanocomposite cement paste for applications to structural health monitoring of concrete structures. The authors have recently developed an innovative sensor, the carbon nanotube cement-based sensor (CNTCS), made from a nanocomposite cement paste. This CNTCS is durable because it is fabricated with a material that has a life expectancy similar to the one of the monitored structure, and provides a natural strong mechanical bond with structural concrete. These characteristics enable embedded and spatially distributed sensing. The CNTCS was conceived to conduct vibration-based structural health monitoring.This chapter presents an overview of the sensing properties of cement pastes doped with multiwalled carbon nanotubes. After introducing the topic, including a brief state of the art on multifunctional cement-based materials, the fabrication process of the CNTCSs is discussed. Then, unstrained and strained electrical responses of the nanocomposite sensors are discussed and interpreted in light of a lumped electromechanical circuit model used to characterize both the polarization effects and the sensing capability of the CNTCSs. Finally, a proof-of-concept laboratory application consisting of vibration monitoring and modal identification of a full-scale concrete beam is presented, where outputs of CNTCSs are benchmarked against mature off-the-shelf sensing technologies.},

  abstract  = {The technical challenges of managing the health of critical infrastructure systems necessitate greater structural sensing capabilities. Among these needs is the ability for quantitative, spatial damage detection on critical structural components. Advances in material science have now opened the door for novel and cost-effective spatial sensing solutions specially tailored for damage detection in structures. However, challenges remain before spatial damage detection can be realized. Some of the technical challenges include sensor installations and extensive signal processing requirements. This work addresses these challenges by developing a patterned carbon nanotube composite thin film sensor whose pattern has been optimized for measuring the spatial distribution of strain. The carbon nanotube-polymer nanocomposite sensing material is fabricated on a flexible polyimide substrate using a layer-by-layer deposition process. The thin film sensors are then patterned into sensing elements using optical lithography processes common to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. The sensor array is designed as a series of sensing elements with varying width to provide insight on the limitations of such patterning and implications of pattern geometry on sensing signals. Once fabrication is complete, the substrate and attached sensor are epoxy bonded to a poly vinyl composite (PVC) bar that is then tested with a uniaxial, cyclic load pattern and mechanical response is characterized. The fabrication processes are then utilized on a larger-scale to develop and instrument a component-specific sensing skin in order to observe the strain distribution on the web of a steel beam. The instrumented beam is part of a larger steel beam-column connection with a concrete slab in composite action. The beam-column subassembly is laterally loaded and strain trends in the web are observed using the carbon nanotube composite sensing skin. The results are discussed in the context of understanding the properties of the thin film sensor and how it may be advanced toward structural sensing applications. {\textcopyright}2014 SPIE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017, ICE Publishing. All rights reserved. Concrete sensors, which are manufactured by mixing conductive fibres (such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) with concrete, are one of the most significant and economical types of sensor. Two main factors affecting the performance of concrete sensors are the amount of CNTs and the quality of their dispersion in the mixture with regard to the combined effects of the surfactant composition and CNTs dispersed with different levels of energy. The goal of this research was to evaluate the effects of the main parameters affecting concrete sensor performance using various criteria (sensitivity of the sensor, standard deviation of the prediction error, repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis) in both static and dynamic loading regimes. Dynamic criteria such as sensitivity, internal repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis showed that the energy levels for the dispersion of CNTs have a greater effect on improving sensor performance than the amount of CNTs. On the contrary, the repeatability indicated that the amount of CNTs has a greater effect on sensor performance than the dispersion quality (energy level) of the CNTs. On the whole, the sensor produced with 0{\textperiodcentered}15 wt{\%} (by weight of cement) CNTs, superplasticiser and sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant using the maximum energy level (ultrasonic bath for 2 h and 90 min of probe's ultrasonication) offered the best performance both in the static and dynamic load regimes.},

abstract = {The self sensing properties of cementitious composites reinforced with well dispersed carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers were investigated. The electrical resistance of cementitious nanocomposites with w/c = 0.3 reinforced with well dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanofibers (CNFs) at an amount of 0.1 wt{\%} and 0.3 wt{\%} of cement was experimentally determined and compared with resistivity results of nanocomposites fabricated with "as received" nanoscale fibers at the same loading. Results indicate that conductivity measurements, besides being a valuable tool in evaluating the smart properties of the nanocomposites, may provide a good correlation between the resistivity values measured and the degree of dispersion of the material in the matrix. The addition of CNTs and CNFs at different loadings was proven to induce a decrease in electrical resistance, with the nanocomposites containing 0.1 wt{\%} CNTs yielding better electrical properties. Furthermore, conductivity measurements under cyclic compressive loading provided an insight in the piezoresistive properties of selected nanocomposites. Results confirm that nanocomposites, reinforced with 0.1 wt{\%} CNTs and CNFs, exhibited an increased change in resistivity, which is indicative of the amplified sensitivity of the material in strain sensing.

abstract = {Real time damage detection of concrete structure is becoming more and more critical. In this paper, damage in carbon fiber-reinforced concrete (CFRC) under uniaxial compression and three-point-bending conditions was monitored by both electrical resistance measurement and acoustic emission (AE) analysis. The research showed a good correlation existing among curve of load–deflection, changes in electrical resistance and AE hits. For CFRC, the electrical conductivity depends on the percolation network formed by the contacting carbon fiber. The damage occurring inside materials causes breakdown of percolation network and results in an increase in electrical resistance. Therefore, the change in electrical resistance reflects the damage during the entire loading process. On the other hand, AE technique can detect and possibly identify damage mechanisms in fiber-reinforced composites by analyzing AE parameters. These two techniques are complementary for the monitoring damage in CFRC.},

Upon strain in the elastic regime, the compression surface resistance decreases reversibly (due to increase in the current penetration), while the tension surface resistance increases reversibly (due to decrease in the current penetration), and the oblique resistance increases reversibly. Upon minor damage, (i) the oblique resistance after unloading decreases, (ii) the oblique resistance decreases during load increase near the start of loading, and (iii) the curve of the oblique resistance or the resistance of the tension or compression surface vs. deflection becomes nonlinear. Upon major damage, all resistances abruptly and irreversibly increase, such that the onset occurs earlier for the compression surface resistance and the oblique resistance than the tension surface resistance. The surface resistances are superior indicators of strain, whereas the oblique resistance is a superior indicator of damage.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors conducted an experiment where a reinforced concrete beam was instrumented with a 5-m long polyimide single distributed optical fibre sensors (DOFS) performing four equal segments externally bonded to the bottom surface of the element, using for each segment a different type of adhesive. Three strain gauges were also used for comparison purposes. This beam was then loaded, producing expected equal levels of strain in each of the fibre segments for a more direct comparison of the different adhesives performance. The effect of alternating the spatial resolution is also analysed. In this exercise, additionally to the comparison with the other instrumented sensors, it is also important the consideration and analysis of the associated spectral shift quality (SSQ) values of the DOFS measurements. {\textcopyright}2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Self-sensing materials are capable of sensing the occurring strains and damage states present within. Smart concrete pavement made with cement-based self-sensing materials could be used for in situ monitoring of both the structural integrity as well as traffic characteristics. This article studies the electrical resistivity and piezoresistivity of cement enriched with multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under cyclic loading. The effects of fatigue damage and environmental factors, such as temperature, water content, and freeze-thaw cycles, on the resistivity and piezoresistivity were investigated. The test results show that the resistivity increases with the number of fatigue loading cycles. On the other hand, the resistivity decreases as the water content increases. In contrast, the piezoresistivity increases first and then decreases. The temperature has a significant yet offsetting effect on the electrical resistivity as well as the piezoresistivity. As the temperature increases, the electrical resistivity decreases, whereas the piezoresistivity increases. The major cause of the change in electrical resistivity and piezoresistivity was the change of tunneling conduction under different conditions. Moreover, the freeze-thaw cycles induce damage to the CNT-cement composite material. Therefore, the data collected by self-sensing materials must be calibrated for the water content and temperature before interpretation. {\textcopyright}2019 by ASTM International.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) and vibration-based structural damage detection have been a continuous interest for civil, mechanical and aerospace engineers over the decades. Early and meticulous damage detection has always been one of the principal objectives of SHM applications. The performance of a classical damage detection system predominantly depends on the choice of the features and the classifier. While the fixed and hand-crafted features may either be a sub-optimal choice for a particular structure or fail to achieve the same level of performance on another structure, they usually require a large computation power which may hinder their usage for real-time structural damage detection. This paper presents a novel, fast and accurate structural damage detection system using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that has an inherent adaptive design to fuse both feature extraction and classification blocks into a single and compact learning body. The proposed method performs vibration-based damage detection and localization of the damage in real-time. The advantage of this approach is its ability to extract optimal damage-sensitive features automatically from the raw acceleration signals. Large-scale experiments conducted on a grandstand simulator revealed an outstanding performance and verified the computational efficiency of the proposed real-time damage detection method.},

  abstract  = {Cement pastes reinforced with Multi-Walled carbon Nano Tubes (MWNTs) are smart materials with piezoresistivity properties. Adding carbon nanotubes to the cement matrix, in fact, the electrical resistivity of cementitious composites changes with the stress conditions under static and dynamic loads. This particular behaviour can be used to evaluate the stress level in reinforced concrete structures, to monitor the traffic flow, to weigh vehicles. In this paper data on pressure-sensitive behaviour under compressive stress of cement pastes and mortars containing different percentages (from 0.0{\%} to 1.0{\%} vs. cement mass) of MWNTs are presented. In order to form a conductive network and enhancethe piezoresistive properties of cementitious mixtures, Carbon Nano Tubes (CNTs) need to be efficiently dispersed in the cement matrix. Two different methods to disperse CNTsin the cement matrix were used. The first one uses a surfactant (Sodium Linear Alkyl Benzene Sulphonate - LAS): MWNTs were dispersed in a LAS aqueous solution,and thenmixed with cement and a defoamer (tributyl phosphate) to decrease the air bubble in MWNT filled cement-based composites. The second method consists in mixing CNTs with about 50{\%} of the mixing water in a becker by means of a glass wand. Then, the solution is sonicated by an ultrasonic generator for 10 minutes. Finally, the sonicatedCNT-aqueous solution ismixed with cement (and sand for the mortars). The piezoresistivity properties of the cementitious mixtures manufactured with the two above mentioned CNTs dispersing methods will be compared. Experimental results show that the electrical resistance changes synchronously with the compressive stress levelsfor the specimens manufactured with both methods. Therefore, CNTs improve the pressure-sensitivity of cementitious composites. Moreover, the piezoresistive response is better for cementitious composites manufactured by using the surfactant agent to disperse CNTs. Data indicate that thanks to the better dispersion of nanotubes promoted by the surfactant - the pressure-sensitivity properties of cement pastes can be achieved even by using a very low percentage of CNTS (0.1{\%} vs. cement mass). These findings seem to indicate that self-sensing CNTs/cement composite can be produced. These smart materials have great potential and they could be used in the next future in concrete field for practical applications to monitor the stress level of reinforced concrete elements subjected to static, dynamic and impact loads. In particular, informations on actual stress existing under dynamic and impact loads could be improve design procedures in protective structures.},

abstract = {Cementitious materials doped with carbon nanoparticles are robust materials capable of transducing strain into changes in electrical resistance. These properties encourage the development of spatially distributed sensors for structural health monitoring of concrete structures. Yet, very few applications of transducers made of cement-based nanocomposites to structural elements have been documented. The majority of applications are limited to measurement of static responses. The authors have recently proposed the novel application of cement-based nanocomposite technologies for vibration-based structural health monitoring of concrete structures. To this aim, prismatic sensors made of cement paste doped with carbon nanotubes have been proposed as embedded sensors for concrete structures. Prior results have shown the promise of these sensors at vibration measurements. In this paper, the authors further the understanding of the dynamic behavior of cement-based carbon nanotube sensors by conducting experiments on a full-scale reinforced concrete beam for output-only identification of natural frequencies. The performance of the novel sensor is benchmarked against off-the-shelf strain gauges and accelerometers. Results show that the proposed sensor compares well against existing technologies at vibration monitoring. Also, the nanocomposite sensor is capable of detecting high frequencies, which is made possible by a very low level of noise and an excellent signal-to-noise ratio obtained from shielded wire connections and proper tailoring of the fabrication process.

This paper introduces the state of art studies on the fabrication technologies of CNT-incorporated cementitious composites and provides in-depth information on the functional characteristics of the composites.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to design a multifunctional cement composite that could not only bear loads but also possessed electromechanical properties that are sensitive to damage. A mainstream approach is to disperse large quantities of conductive additives in the cement matrix, which can be costly, involve complex procedures, difficult to scale-up, and degrade concrete's inherent mechanical properties. Instead, this research proposes a new method to design multifunctional and self-sensing concrete, which is achieved by altering the cement–aggregate interface using conductive, nano-engineered coatings. Here, a carbon nanotube–based ink solution was sprayed onto the surfaces of aggregates and then dried to form electrically conductive, thin film-coated aggregates. Then, the film-coated aggregates were used as is for casting concrete specimens. It was demonstrated experimentally that this procedure yielded concrete specimens that were not only conductive but also had electrical properties that varied in response to applied physical damage. An electrical impedance tomography algorithm was also implemented and used for estimating their spatial resistivity distributions. Since the electrical properties at every location of the film-enhanced concrete were sensitive to damage, electrical impedance tomography was able to produce electrical resistivity maps that indicated the locations and severities of damage. Multiple concrete cylinder, plate, and beam specimens were cast and tested for validating the self-sensing properties of film-enhanced concrete and the spatial damage detection capabilities of the electrical impedance tomography algorithm.},

abstract = {Cementitious composites such as concrete pavements are susceptible to different damage modes, which are primarily caused by repeated loading and long-term deterioration. There is even greater concern that damage could worsen and occur more frequently with the use of heavier vehicles or new aircraft carrying greater payloads. Thus, the objective of this research is to engineer cementitious composites with capabilities of self-sensing or detecting damage. The approach was to enhance the damage sensitivity of cementitious composites by incorporating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) as part of the mix design and during casting. However, as opposed to directly dispersing MWNTs in the cement matrix, which is the current state-of-art, MWNT-based thin films were airbrushed and coated onto sand particles. The film-coated sand was then used as part of the mix design for casting mortar specimens. Mortar specimens were subjected to compressive cyclic loading tests while their electrical properties were recorded simultaneously. The results showed that the electrical properties of these cementitious composites designed with film-coated sand exhibited extremely high strain sensitivities. The electrical response was also stable and consistent between specimens.},

abstract = {The authors have recently explored the use of electrically conductive cement-based composites doped with carbon nanotubes for dynamic monitoring of strain in concrete structures. While the technology appears to be very promising for cost-effective structural health monitoring, some challenges still limit its applicability to full-scale constructions. The dispersion of the nanoparticles, typically based on sonic treatment and on other special procedures, is not compatible with distributed full-scale deployments and essentially limits the applications of the technology to the fabrication of embeddable sensors. Also, the electromechanical behaviour of the composites is complex and a proper analytical model linking electrical output to accurate strain measurements is yet to be established. This work discusses these open issues in fabrication and modelling of carbon nanotube composite concrete. A fabrication procedure with potential applicability to large casting volumes is presented and experimental results highlighting its effectiveness are discussed. Results cover analysis of nanoparticles dispersion, electrical percolation, strain sensitivity and polarization.},

abstract = {This study focused on enhancing the self-sensing ability of engineered cementitious composites (ECC) to accurately monitor their cracking behavior and healing performance. The ultimate goal was to develop an advanced smart material that combines self-sensing and self-healing capacities, while preserving the high mechanical and ductility properties of standard ECC. To achieve those features, carbon fibers (CF) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) were added to ECC mixtures in different concentrations. Compressive and flexural strength and mid-span beam deflection capacity testing of sound specimens were performed as part of the mechanical characterization. Recovery rates of flexural properties were assessed on pre-cracked specimens at different healing ages. The combined self-sensing and self-healing capabilities of sound and pre-cracked specimens were evaluated based on electrical resistivity (ER) measurements completed at different moisture states and healing ages. Microstructural analysis was used to investigate outer and inner regions of healed crack lines. Test results showed that mechanical properties, self-healing ability and conductivity of ECC can be improved by incorporating CNFs or CNTs. However, accurate combined self-sensing and self-healing efficiency can only be reached with CNT-based ECCs.},

In this study, a piezoelectric-based active sensing system was used to conduct the structural health monitoring (SHM) of a one-bay, two-story reinforced concrete (RC) space frame structure subjected to earthquake loadings. The RC frame in which were installed piezoelectric-based actuators and sensors was tested on a shaking table with ground excitation of various intensities. The embedded sensors in the RC frame were used to diagnose the health status of the tested RC frame during the tests, and an energy-base damage index was adopted to quantify the severity of the damage. The test results indicate that the piezoelectric-based active sensing method for SHM revealed the severity of damage of the tested RC frame after earthquake excitations. A simplified and accurate method for simulating the dynamic responses of the tested RC space frame is presented; it was based on the moment-curvature method and identified fundamental frequencies. The calculated displacement time histories and maximum ductility demands of the structural members were compared with those measured in the shake table test, and excellent agreement was achieved.},

abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring is a topic of growing significance in Civil and Mechanical Engineering, whereby an effective monitoring of a structure can lead to cost-effective maintenance and can enhance occupants' safety. A distributed monitoring system can better identify, localize and quantify incipient damages and variations of the structural behavior compared to a sparse utilization of off-the-shelf sensors. This is due to the spatial distribution limitation of conventional sensors, providing partial information for a subsequent structural diagnosis. They are also denoted by durability issues and high implementation cost. Owing to recent advances in Nanotechnology, new smart materials are becoming available, enabling the development of distributed sensing solutions for structural health monitoring. In particular, novel conductive piezoresistive nanofillers, such as carbon nanotubes and nanofibers, have showed promise towards realizing cementitious materials with self-sensing capabilities. In such materials, the change in strain or stress is detectable through the variation of given electrical properties, such as resistance or conductivity. The nanomodified cementitious sensors can be embedded into structural elements and therefore provides a distributed sensing system. Investigating important issues related to their composition, their fabrication and their electrical characteristics, will lead to their broad implementation. This paper is aimed at investigating the dispersion of nanoinclusions in the cement matrix, the electrical conductivity, and the strain/stress sensitivity of samples of cement paste, mortar and concrete fabricated with Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Carbon Nanofibers (CNFs). The results of the electromechanical experimental tests, including tests conducted on full-scale concrete elements, show that these new sensors can be effectively used for monitoring the health of structures.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the fields of nanocomposite technologies have enabled the development of highly scalable, low-cost sensing solution for civil infrastructures. This includes two sensing technologies, recently proposed by the authors, engineered for their high scalability, low-cost and mechanical simplicity. The first sensor consists of a smart-cementitious material doped with multi-wall carbon nanotubes, which has been demonstrated to be suitable for monitoring its own deformations (strain) and damage state (cracks). Integrated to a structure, this smart cementitious material can be used for detecting damage or strain through the monitoring of its electrical properties. The second sensing technology consists of a sensing skin developed from a flexible capacitor that is mounted externally onto the structure. When deployed in a dense sensor network configuration, these large area sensors are capable of covering large surfaces at low cost and can monitor both strain-and crack-induced damages. This work first presents a comparison of the capabilities of both technologies for crack detection in a concrete plate, followed by a fusion of sensor data for increased damage detection performance. Experimental results are conducted on a 50 50 5 cm3 plate fabricated with smart concrete and equipped with a dense sensor network of 20 large area sensors.

@article{Al-Dahawi2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 Elsevier Ltd Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) are emerging construction materials with proven mechanical and durability characteristics. These outstanding properties make the material an attractive choice for different infrastructure types. But the growing use of ECCs brings about the need to monitor the health of the structures that employ them. This study therefore focused on the self-sensing capability of ECC with different carbon-based materials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes [CNT], graphene nanoplatelets [GNP], carbon black [CB] and carbon fibers [CF]) when subjected to repetitive loading and unloading cycles within the elastic and plastic ranges. Tests were conducted on beam specimens loaded and unloaded under four-point bending loading. Within the elastic range, 30{\%} of the ultimate flexural strength was decided for application on the tested specimens. For the plastic range, prismatic specimens prepared for cyclic flexural loading at high levels were loaded up to 70{\%} of their ultimate flexural strength. Experimental findings showed that for all proposed ECC mixtures, self-sensing of imposed damage (i.e. loading) was successful for both elastic and plastic ranges, while the self-sensing of load removal (i.e. unloading) in the elastic range was not achieved as successfully. This was most probably due to very small imposed damage and continuously increasing intrinsic electrical resistivity of individual carbon-based materials under loading, which cannot be discharged upon unloading. Compared to other carbon-based materials, CF utilization during ECC production was the most effective method for self-sensing of cyclic loading and unloading in the elastic and plastic ranges. Improving the proven superior mechanical and durability properties of ECC materials with self-sensing characteristic will multiply the benefits for truly sustainable infrastructures.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2019, American Concrete Institute. The majority of self-sensing studies conducted in current literature uses small-scale specimens without steel reinforcement which might be misleading for damage monitoring in actual structures. To account for this, herein, the main emphasis was placed on self-sensing evaluation of large-scale (100 x 150 x 1000 mm3 [3.94 x 5.91 x 39.4 in.3] width x height x length) reinforced mortar beam elements tested under four-point bending. For the purposes of self-sensing, either chopped carbon fibers (CFs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used in beams to achieve desirable electrical properties. Assessment of self-sensing was made by tracking the fractional changes in electrical resistivity (FCER) with respect to midspan beam displacement under flexural loading. Results related to electrical properties were recorded from brass electrodes embedded in specimens in fresh state using a resistivity meter using alternating current. Self-sensing results of large-scale beams were also backed by mechanical/structural characterization. Experimental findings suggest that use of CF and CNT in beam elements is significantly effective in modifying the overall failure types for the given reinforcement configuration. Proposed measurement setup is successful in capturing the flexural self-sensing data regardless of the type of carbon-based material. At low levels of damage, for both CF- and CNT-bearing beams, self-sensing and damage occurrence measured by the level of beam deformation are well-fit to each other, although this is clearer for specimens with CF. However, at high levels of damage, most probably due to rupturing of individual fibers, clearer abrupt changes in FCER results of CF-bearing beams are monitored, although this is not the case for beams with CNT. Taking into account the production cost, performance, and easier mixability of different carbon-based materials within the relatively dense cementitious systems of beam elements, use of CF seems to be more advantageous than the use of CNT for an efficient self-sensing assessment of real-time structural elements.},

Incorporation of CNTs can significantly improve the properties of cement-based materials, especially the electrical conductivity. However, agglomeration of CNTs is frequently encountered which can largely weaken the functionality of composites. In this work, enhanced dispersion of carbon nanotubes in cement-based materials has been achieved by using three dispersants and in combination with ultrasonic vibration. The influence of dispersants on the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of cement paste incorporated with CNTs has been investigated. It is shown that enhanced dispersion of CNTs achieved by the use of dispersants significantly improves the electrical conductivity through the formation of electrical networks in the cement-based composite at mature stage. Air bubbles introduced by the dispersant in cement-based composites reduces its electrical conductivity significantly. Moreover, the air bubbles also lead to a large decrease of the compressive strength of CNTs reinforced cement-based composites.},

Application of nanomaterials in different sectors has shown that the properties of conventional materials can be significantly improved when nanoparticles are included. The addition of nanoparticles in cementitious materials can act as a filler agent, producing a dense matrix and reduce the growth of micro pores. Some nanoparticles also help in the secondary reactions forming cement composite and contribute to the strength development. Moreover, this paper summarises the current knowledge of the microstructure, mechanical strength and durability of cementitious materials when incorporating different types of nanoparticles. In addition, research needs are identified based on the gaps in the current state of knowledge on using nanoparticles in cement-based construction materials. {\textcopyright}2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In the structural healthy monitoring of bridges, pavements of concrete or asphalt, flexible conductive sensors exhibit so many advantages, such as low cost, high durability, and large deformation monitoring. Herein, we report a low cost flexible composite sensor of multi-walled carbon nanotubes/Polydimethylsilosane (MWCNTs/PDMS) nanocomposites via solution casting method. Results show that MWCNTs/PDMS reveals excellent sensitivity and good stability when the fraction of MWCNTs is larger than the threshold (2.5 wt{\%}). The compressive strain of reactive powder concrete was lineal with the resistance change of sensor ( {\$}\Delta{\$} R/R0) in the range of elastic deformation, while the deflection of reactive powder concrete could be predicted by the fitting exponential equation from the electric resistance change of MWCNTs/PDMS. These results highlight MWCNTs/PDMS nanocomposite as strain sensor in the structural health monitoring of reactive powder concrete structures. {\textcopyright}2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the introductory chapters, we have discussed various causes that can create damages in pipelines. These include chemical and stress corrosion, sudden variation in gravity and thermal loading, flow-induced vibration, impact damage at the pipe joints. We have also discussed how different sensors can be used for sensing these damages. Optical and Laser Scanning, Magnetic Flux Leakage Analysis, Microwave and Ultrasonic Sensing are some of the techniques discussed in the overview. However, most of the above-mentioned sensors generate high density of data creating challenges for data storage as well communication. Smart material-based sensors like PVDF sensing are more advantageous in such cases. PVDF sensor is developed from a subset of polymeric piezoelectric material; the nature and constitutive relationship of such smart materials are discussed at length in the earlier chapter. In this chapter, we will more focus on the use of such smart materials in developing structural health monitoring (SHM) System. As a background to this discussion, it will be important for us to briefly review the concept and scope of SHM. {\textcopyright}Springer (India) Private Ltd. 2018.},

In this paper, the accelerated curing and thermal cracking reduction with carbon nanotube (CNT)/cement composites are studied experimentally and theoretically. The heating element was fabricated by incorporation CNT into cement, and the cementitious composite block was placed in the middle of mortar samples. In order to generate and evaluate the heating performance, copper wires connected to the composite block were extended to a DC power supply. The variations of material characteristics including curing, thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of both the composite block and the sample were investigated. The experimental test results showed that the proposed curing was capable of improving the compressive strength by 40{\%} at 24 h. In addition, based on the experimentally obtained material constants, a series of thermal analysis of mitigation level of thermal crack in larger scale were carried out. The electrically conductive CNT/cement composite block was found to be applicable to the cement mortar curing and reduction of thermal cracking of massive concretes structures.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are on the frontline of materials research and innovations worldwide. There is a growing interest in CNTs due to their superior mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. The electrical conductivity of individual CNTs is in the order of 104-107 S/m. The incorporation of CNTs in concrete leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of the CNT/concrete composite. Recently, the use of CNTs in concrete in structural health monitoring has attracted a lot of attention. CNTs/cement composite have shown piezoresistivity property where the electrical resistance of the composite varies with load. This property offers a practical way to sense load variations by monitoring the electrical resistivity of the structure. This paper will give an overview of the current research efforts in this regard. The review will cover the use of both functionalised and pristine CNTs. An overview of the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method which is most commonly used to synthesise CNTs will also be presented. Copyright {\textcopyright}2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract = {Self-sensing property of concrete is mostly assessed using small specimens without reinforcement, which may be misleading for real-time structures. To better simulate the actual field conditions, this study examined self-sensing of damage in large-scale reinforced concrete beams tested under four-point bending. During flexural testing, special attention was paid to the self-sensing capability of shear failure, since this type of failure occurs suddenly and catastrophically. Inadequate shear reinforcements were used to increase shear failure possibility of 100 × 150 × 1000 mm 3 (width × height × length) reinforced large-scale beams and beams were produced with a high shear span (a = 350 mm) to effective depth (d = 125 mm) ratio of 2.8. To increase the electrical conductivity of large-scale beams, chopped carbon fibers (CF) and multi-walled carbon nano tubes (CNT) were used. Instantaneous self-sensing recordings were made using brass electrodes embedded in different shear spans of beams. In addition to conducting self-sensing evaluations, researchers also investigated the effects of CF and CNT particles on the mechanical properties/structural behavior of large-scale beam specimens with the proposed reinforcement configuration. Results showed that compared to CNT, CF usage significantly improved the load carrying capacity and ductility, resulting in bending mode of failure even with indaquate shear reinforcement. Shear damage was successfully self-sensed in all tested beams, although all CF-based specimens started self-sensing from the beginning of loading with significantly higher changes in electrical resistivity results, unlike CNT-based specimens. Conductive network of CF-based specimens seemed to be disturbed more easily at high load levels. CF usage seems like a better option compared to CNT given its lower cost and easier mixability.},

These composites exhibit strain-sensing capabilities providing measurable variations of their electrical properties under applied mechanical deformations. This unique property, together with the similarity between these composites and structural concrete, suggests the possibility of developing distributed strain-sensing systems with substantial improvements in the cost-effectiveness of large-scale concrete structures. In order to design and optimize self-sensing CNT-based composites, it is therefore essential to develop theoretical models capable of simulating the relationship between external mechanical strains and the effective electrical conductivity. This paper presents a micromechanics model to predict the piezoresistive properties of CNT cement-based nanocomposites, with the consideration of waviness and non-uniform distributions of nanoinclusions. The origin of the piezoresistive response is attributed to (i) strain-induced changes in the volume fraction, (ii) filler reorientation and, (iii) changes in the tunneling resistance. In order to count on an experimental basis to use as benchmark for validation, several nanocomposite cement-based specimens are manufactured and tested under uniaxial compression.},

abstract = {The paper presents a study on the use of cement-based sensors doped with carbon nanotubes as embedded smart sensors for static and dynamic strain monitoring of reinforced concrete (RC) elements. Such novel sensors can be used for the monitoring of civil infrastructures. Because they are fabricated from a structural material and are easy to utilize, these sensors can be integrated into structural elements for monitoring of different types of constructions during their service life. Despite the scientific attention that such sensors have received in recent years, further research is needed to understand (i) the repeatability and accuracy of sensors' behavior over a meaningful number of sensors, (ii) testing configurations and calibration methods, and (iii) the sensors' ability to provide static and dynamic strain measurements when actually embedded in RC elements. To address these research needs, this paper presents a preliminary characterization of the self-sensing capabilities and the dynamic properties of a meaningful number of cement-based sensors and studies their application as embedded sensors in a full-scale RC beam. Results from electrical and electromechanical tests conducted on small and full-scale specimens using different electrical measurement methods confirm that smart cement-based sensors show promise for both static and vibration-based structural health monitoring applications of concrete elements but that calibration of each sensor seems to be necessary.},

These composites exhibit self-sensing capabilities providing measurable variations of their electrical properties under the application of mechanical deformations. Together with this exceptional property, the similarity and compatibility between these composites and structural concrete suggest the possibility of developing distributed embedded strain-sensing systems with substantial improvements in the cost-effectiveness in applications to large-scale concrete structures. In order to design and optimize CNT reinforced cement based dynamic sensors, it is fundamental to develop theoretical models capable of simulating the relationship between dynamic mechanical strains and the effective electrical conductivity. This paper presents an electromechanical modeling of the Direct Current (DC) electrical resistance of CNT reinforced cement paste sensors based on a piezoelectric/piezoresistive lumped circuit. The model represents an enhanced version and a generalization of another model previously proposed by the authors. Previously published experimental results have been used as validation benchmark. In particular, experimental tests concerning the characterization of the step response under unloaded conditions, steady state response under harmonic loadings and sweep analyses are considered. The results demonstrate that the newly proposed model is superior in comparison to the previous one in reproducing the dynamic response of the sensors when subjected to harmonic mechanical loads. Overall, an excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is achieved.},

We find that x significantly influences the chemical bonding, which leads to a pronounced change in the hardness of the film. To reveal the relationship between the chemical bonding and hardness, first-principles calculations have been carried out. It is shown that as x increases from 0 to 0.33, the fraction of sp3 CGe bonds in the film increases at the expense of GeGe bonds, which promotes formation of a strong covalently bonded network, and thus enhances the hardness of the film. However, as x further increases from 0.33 to 0.59, the fraction of sp3 CGe bonds in the film gradually reduces, while that of sp3 CH and graphite-like sp2 CC bonds increases, which damages the compact network structure, resulting in a sharp decrease in the hardness. This investigation suggests that the medium x (0.17{\textless}x{\textless}0.40) is most favorable to the preparation of hard Ge 1-xCx films due to the formation of dominant sp 3 CGe bonds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract      = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have excellent electrical, mechanical and electromechanical properties. When CNTs are incorporated into polymers, electrically conductive composites with high electrical conductivity at very low CNT content (often below 1\% wt CNT) result. Due to the change in electrical properties under mechanical load, carbon nanotube/polymer composites have attracted significant research interest especially due to their potential for application in in-situ monitoring of stress distribution and active control of strain sensing in composite structures or as strain sensors. To sucessfully develop novel devices for such applications, some of the major challenges that need to be overcome include; in-depth understanding of structure-electrical conductivity relationships, response of the composites under changing environmental conditions and piezoresistivity of different types of carbon nanotube/polymer sensing devices.

In this thesis, direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) conductivity of CNT-epoxy composites was investigated. Details of microstructure obtained by scanning electron microscopy were used to link observed electrical properties with structure using equivalent circuit modeling. The role of polymer coatings on macro and micro level electrical conductivity was investigated using atomic force microscopy.

Thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy were used to evaluate the heat flow and deformation of carbon nanotubes embedded in the epoxy, respectively, and related to temperature induced resistivity changes. A comparative assessment of piezoresistivity was conducted using randomly mixed carbon nanotube/epoxy composites, and new concept epoxy- and polyurethane-coated carbon nanotube films.

The results indicate that equivalent circuit modelling is a reliable technique for estimating values of the resistance and capacitive components in linear, low aspect ratio-epoxy composites. Using this approach, the dominant role of tunneling resistance in determining the electrical conductivity was confirmed, a result further verified using conductive-atomic force microscopy analysis. Randomly mixed CNT-epoxy composites were found to be highly sensitive to mechanical strain and temperature variation compared to polymer-coated CNT films. In the vicinity of the glass transition temperature, the CNT-epoxy composites exhibited pronounced resistivity peaks.

Thermal and Raman spectroscopy analyses indicated that this phenomenon can be attributed to physical aging of the epoxy matrix phase and structural rearrangement of the conductive network induced by matrix expansion. The resistivity of polymercoated CNT composites was mainly dominated by the intrinsic resistivity of CNTs and the CNT junctions, and their linear, weakly temperature sensitive response can be described by a modified Luttinger liquid model. Piezoresistivity of the polymer coated sensors was dominated by break up of the conducting carbon nanotube network and the consequent degradation of nanotube-nanotube contacts while that of the randomly mixed CNT-epoxy composites was determined by tunnelling resistance between neighbouring CNTs.

This thesis has demonstrated that it is possible to use microstructure information to develop equivalent circuit models that are capable of representing the electrical conductivity of CNT/epoxy composites accurately. New designs of carbon nanotube based sensing devices, utilising carbon nanotube films as the key functional element, can be used to overcome the high temperature sensitivity of randomly mixed CNT/polymer composites without compromising on desired high strain sensitivity. This concept can be extended to develop large area intelligent CNT based coatings and targeted weak-point specific strain sensors for use in structural health monitoring. },

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Investigation of multi-functional carbon-based self-sensing structural materials for structural health monitoring applications is a topic of growing interest. These materials are self-sensing in the sense that they can provide measurable electrical outputs corresponding to physical changes such as strain or induced damage. Nevertheless, the development of an appropriate measurement technique for such materials is yet to be achieved, as many results in the literature suggest that these materials exhibit a drift in their output when measured with direct current (DC) methods. In most of the cases, the electrical output is a resistance and the reported drift is an increase in resistance from the time the measurement starts due to material polarization. Alternating current methods seem more appropriate at eliminating the time drift. However, published results show they are not immune to drift. Moreover, the use of multiple impedance measurement devices (LCR meters) does not allow for the simultaneous multi-channel sampling of multi-sectioned self-sensing materials due to signal crosstalk. The capability to simultaneously monitor multiple sections of self-sensing structural materials is needed to deploy these multi-functional materials for structural health monitoring. Here, a biphasic DC measurement approach with a periodic measure/discharge cycle in the form of a square wave sensing current is used to provide consistent, stable resistance measurements for self-sensing structural materials. DC measurements are made during the measurement region of the square wave while material depolarization is obtained during the discharge region of the periodic signal. The proposed technique is experimentally shown to remove the signal drift in a carbon-based self-sensing cementitious material while providing simultaneous multi-channel measurements of a multi-sectioned self-sensing material. The application of the proposed electrical measurement technique appears promising for real-time utilization of self-sensing materials in structural health monitoring.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Structural health monitoring consists of using sensors integrated within structures together with algorithms to perform load monitoring, damage detection, damage location, damage size and severity, and prognosis. One possibility is to use strain sensors to infer structural integrity by comparing patterns in the strain field between the pristine and damaged conditions. In previous works, the authors have demonstrated that it is possible to detect small defects based on strain field pattern recognition by using robust machine learning techniques. They have focused on methodologies based on principal component analysis (PCA) and on the development of several unfolding and standardization techniques, which allow dealing with multiple load conditions. However, before a real implementation of this approach in engineering structures, changes in the strain field due to conditions different from damage occurrence need to be isolated. Since load conditions may vary in most engineering structures and promote significant changes in the strain field, it is necessary to implement novel techniques for uncoupling such changes from those produced by damage occurrence. A damage detection methodology based on optimal baseline selection (OBS) by means of clustering techniques is presented. The methodology includes the use of hierarchical nonlinear PCA as a nonlinear modeling technique in conjunction with Q and nonlinear-T 2 damage indices. The methodology is experimentally validated using strain measurements obtained by 32 fiber Bragg grating sensors bonded to an aluminum beam under dynamic bending loads and simultaneously submitted to variations in its pitch angle. The results demonstrated the capability of the methodology for clustering data according to 13 different load conditions (pitch angles), performing the OBS and detecting six different damages induced in a cumulative way. The proposed methodology showed a true positive rate of 100{\%} and a false positive rate of 1.28{\%} for a 99{\%} of confidence.},

In addition, MWNT-embedded cement composites were fabricated under different flows of fresh composite mixtures, incorporating a constant MWNT content (0.6 wt{\%}) to verify correlation between the MWNT distribution and flow. The image analysis demonstrated that the MWNT distribution was significantly enhanced in the composites fabricated under a low flow condition, and DC conductivity results revealed the dramatic increase in the conductivity of the composites fabricated under the same condition, which supported the image analysis results. The composites were also prepared under the low flow condition (114 mm {\textless} flow {\textless} 126 mm), incorporating various MWNT contents. The image analysis of the composites revealed an increase in the planar occupation ratio of MWNT, and DC conductivity results exhibited dramatic increase in the conductivity (percolation phenomena) as the MWNT content increased.

Hence, in this research, the rheological properties of fresh cement paste with different content of graphene (0.03, 0.05 and 0.10{\%} by weight of cement) were investigated. The parameters considered were test geometries (concentric cylinders and parallel plates), shear rate range (300–0.6, 200–0.6 and 100–0.6 s−1), resting time (0, 30 and 60 min) and superplasticizer dosage (0 and 0.1{\%} by weight of cement). Four rheological prediction models such as Modified Bingham, Herschel–Bulkley, Bingham model and Casson model were chosen for the estimation of the yield stress, plastic viscosity and trend of the flow curves. The effectiveness of these rheological models in predicting the flow properties of cement paste was verified by considering the standard error method. Test results showed that the yield stress and the plastic viscosity increased with the increase in graphene content and resting time while the yield stress and the plastic viscosity decreased with the increase in the dosage of superplasticizer. At higher shear rate range, the yield stress increased while the plastic viscosities decreased. The Herschel–Bulkley model with the lowest average standard error and standard deviation value was found to best fit the experimental data, whereas, Casson model was found to be the most unfitted model. Graphene reduces the flow diameter and electrical resistivity up to 9.3 and 67.8{\%} and enhances load carrying capacity and strain up to 16.7 and 70.1{\%} of the composite specimen as compared with plain cement specimen.

In addition, thin film nanocomposites with various MWCNT weight percentages are manufactured and their electrical performance capabilities are measured to verify the predictive capability of the present simulation. From experimental tests, the nanocomposites show clear piezoresistive behaviors, exhibiting a percolation threshold at less than 0.5 wt{\%} of the MWCNTs.

Two polymer models with dissimilar affinities towards CNTs are studied: polyamide-6 (PA6) having high, and polystyrene (PS) having low affinity towards CNTs. Experiments demonstrate that enhanced polymer-filler interactions in PA6-CNT system lead to improved CNT dispersion at the nanoscopic level. However, PS-CNT system, having higher number density of micro-agglomerates, has approximately ten times lower percolation threshold (0.3wt{\%} versus 2.9wt{\%}) and significantly enhanced electrical properties. High affinity of PA6 towards CNTs is proposed to adversely influence electrical properties via encapsulation of CNTs by PA6 through possible wrapping and interfacial crystallization of polymer chains. On the other hand, enhanced electrical properties in PS-CNT nanocomposites are attributed to higher number density of micro-agglomerates, contributing to secondary internal electric field.},
